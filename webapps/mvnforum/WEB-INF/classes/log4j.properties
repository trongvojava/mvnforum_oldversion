#
# NOTE for mvnForum users:
#
# - This log4j configuration is based on the example2 of log4j
# - You should change the file name for the log to the folder mvnForumHome/log
# - You could also change the log level (default is debug)
# - If you deploy to a server, you could disable the appender console  
# - Please see log4j document for more information on configure log4j

# For the general syntax of property based configuration files see the
# documentation of org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.

# WARNING: Location information can be useful but is very costly in terms of computation.

# The root logger uses the appenders called console and A2. Since no level
# is specified, note the empty string between the comma (",") and the
# equals sign ("="), the level of the root logger remains
# untouched. Log4j always initializes the level for the root logger to
# DEBUG. The root logger is the only logger that has a default
# level. By default, all other loggers do not have an assigned level,
# such that they inherit their level instead.
